# Lasso Regression Gradient Descent vs Analytical Ridge Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that contains a project that compares lasso and ridge regression.  

The comparative analysis analyzes the time and space complexities, flop counts, performance times, and numerical precisions.  

The Lasso regression is implemented via gradient descent and the ridge regression is implemented via matrix multiplication (using moore-penrose pseudo inverse).
